
1. Approach:

To complete the task, I followed a structured approach. First, I gathered all the necessary
 information and carefully reviewed the requirements. I then organized the content logically 
 to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the content 
 flowed smoothly and included all key points without being too lengthy. I divided the content into
  sections for a clean presentation, focusing on one topic at a time.

2. Learning:

Through this exercise, I learned new HTML tags such as <hr> for horizontal rules and how to 
structure a page with a header, navigation, and footer. I also gained better understanding in 
designing a clear layout using flexbox for alignment. Additionally, I reinforced the importance of clear,
 concise descriptions and how to organize content for better user experience.
